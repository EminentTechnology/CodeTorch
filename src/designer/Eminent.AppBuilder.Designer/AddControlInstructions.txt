When adding a new control type for configuration we need to edit the following:
1. Add a control abstraction class that defines the control's properties - 
   in CodeTorch.Core -> ControlTypes folder -> typically ends in Control - see LabelControl example
2. Add a control implementation class that inherits from BaseFieldTemplate
   in CodeTorch.Web -> FieldTemplates folder -> typically no suffix
3. Add a schema upgrade in Designer to add new Control Types - see schema 8 upgrade example
4. Implement/Test your control
   a. Typically add a ctrl 
   b. Implement overrides such as InitControl and LoadControl
